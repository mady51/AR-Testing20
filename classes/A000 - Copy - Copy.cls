Page Navigation: When working with several records, breaking data into multiple pages is always a good idea. You can now view 25, 50, 75, or 100 records on a single page, and use the Previous and Next buttons to switch to the previous or next page. This feature is now only available in the Version Control module, but it will be expanded to other modules in future releases.Never miss a required field: You will be prompted to fill in all the required fields before you proceed. Follow the UI highlights to minimize rework.Customize CI jobs for desired Salesforce API versions: To support different Salesforce API versions for distinct Salesforce orgs instead of a global setup, we've added a new checkbox named Salesforce API version across the CI Job module. This will offer a granular facility in a CI job to select the required Salesforce API version.Improved Audit Trail Report: Additional data was added to the reports to support improved report analysis.Performance Improvement: Waiting is always boring- we have reduced that wait for you.//UI UX Improvements: Focused on application performance and user experience.
